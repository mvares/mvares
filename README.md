Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Miguel Tavares.

Currently, I'm active contributor of Reth, Fuels SDK, Alloy and other projects that I find interesting, such as [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono).

I'm very interested in cryptography, distributed systems and backend in general. I mainly code in TypeScript and Rust.
