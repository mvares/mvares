I'm a software engineer focused on backend (distributed systems, data engineering). I speak mainly NodeJS, Rust and Golang.

- I'm active contributor of Reth, Fuels SDK, Alloy and other projects that I find interesting, such as [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono).
- My research interests are in Distributed Systems, Consenseus, IaC and Zero Knowledge Proofs.
