Hi thereðŸ‘‹
My name is Miguel. Currently, I'm active contributor of [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), [Fuels-TS](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts), and other projects that I find interesting, such as [Limbo](https://github.com/penberg/limbo).

I'm very interestind cryptography, distributed systems and backend in general.An interesting fact is that I have a repository that contains all my research (under construction). My favorite book about systems is **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** by **Martin Kleppmann**.

I mainly code in TypeScript and Rust.
