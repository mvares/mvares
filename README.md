Hi thereðŸ‘‹

My name is Miguel. Currently, I'm active contributor of [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), [Fuels-TS](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts), and other projects that I find interesting, such as [Limbo](https://github.com/penberg/limbo).

I'm very interestind cryptography, distributed systems and backend in general. An interesting fact is that I have a repository that contains all my research and I mainly code in TypeScript and Rust.
